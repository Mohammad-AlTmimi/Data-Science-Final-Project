# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project

## Date Created
**June 2024**

## Project Title
**Bike Share Data Analysis**

## Description
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program, where students apply Python programming skills and data analysis techniques to real-world datasets. The goal is to analyze US bike-share data from three major cities and uncover trends in how people use bike-sharing services. The analysis includes:

- Identifying popular travel times.
- Determining the most used stations and trip durations.
- Understanding user demographics based on available data.
- Presenting insights using Python and pandas.

This project helps build foundational skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and working with real-world datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary language for data analysis.
- **pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository management.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: (Optional) For interactive data exploration.

## Files Used
- `bikeshare.py` - Main script for data analysis.
- `chicago.csv` - Bike-share data for Chicago.
- `new_york_city.csv` - Bike-share data for New York City.
- `washington.csv` - Bike-share data for Washington.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files to exclude from version control.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.
